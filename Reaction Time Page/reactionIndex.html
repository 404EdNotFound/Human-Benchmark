        <p>This is a simple tool to measure your reaction time.
        
        The average (median) reaction time is 273 milliseconds, according to the data collected so far.
        
        In addition to measuring your reaction time, this test is affected by the latency of your computer and monitor. Using a
        fast computer and low latency / high framerate monitor will improve your score.
        
        Scores in this test are faster than the aim trainer test, because you can react instantly without moving the cursor.
        
        If you want, you can keep track of your scores, and see your full history of reaction times.
        Just perform at least 5 clicks and then save.</p>
