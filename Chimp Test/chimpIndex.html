        <h2>About!</h2>
        <p>This is a test of working memory, made famous by a study that found that chimpanzees consistently outperform humans on
        this task. In the study, the chimps consistently outperformed humans, and some chimps were able to remember 9 digits over 90% of
        the time. This test is a variant of that concept, that gets increasingly difficult every turn, starting at 4 digits, and adding
        one every turn. If you pass a level, the number increases. If you fail, you get a strike. Three strikes and the test is over.</p>
