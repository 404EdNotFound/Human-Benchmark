            <h2>About!</h2>
            <p>This test measures how many words you can keep in short term memory at once.
            
            The number of words you need to remember grows continually, until you can't keep them in your head anymore.
            
            Go as long as you can. You have 3 strikes until game over.
            
            Your score is how many turns you lasted.</p>
